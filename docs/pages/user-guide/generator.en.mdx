# Generator

Before reading this chapter, please make sure you have read the [Checker](/user-guide/checker) chapter and are familiar with the basic usage of `cplib::var::Var`. This chapter will not repeat the introduction to this part.

The generator is used to generate a input file according to the requirements of the command-line parameters and output to standard output (stdout).

In most cases, only the command-line parameters given at the time of invocation can determine the generation result of the generator. In other words, the generator does not need to process any input streams or input files.

The relevant code for this section can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rindag-devs/cplib/blob/main/tests/generator/0-i32-a-plus-b).

Let's start with a simple example to explain how to write and use the generator.

> **Requirements**: Implement an input file generator for the integer A+B problem, called with the command `./gen [--same] --n-max=<value> --n-min=<value>`. The `n-min` and `n-max` specify the range of integers $a$ and $b$. The `same` flag indicates whether to set $a = b$.

## Implementation

Here is a reference implementation of a generator:

```cpp filename="gen.cpp" copy showLineNumbers
#include "cplib.hpp"

using namespace cplib;

CPLIB_REGISTER_GENERATOR(gen, Args, {
  Var<var::i32> n_min{var::i32("n-min")};
  Var<var::i32> n_max{var::i32("n-max")};
  Flag same{"same"};
});

void generator_main(const Args& args) {
  if (args.n_min.value > args.n_max.value) panic("n_min must be <= n_max");

  int a = gen.rnd.next(args.n_min.value, args.n_max.value);
  int b = args.same.value ? a : gen.rnd.next(args.n_min.value, args.n_max.value);

  std::cout << a << ' ' << b << '\n';

  gen.quit_ok();
}
```

The main difference between the generator and other CPLib work mode is reflected in the `CPLIB_REGISTER_GENERATOR` macro. This macro has three parameters, in order:

- The name of the global variable representing the generator state. This parameter has the same role as the first parameter of the registration macro in other work modes.
- The name of the structure bound to the command-line arguments.
- The implementation of the structure bound to the command-line arguments.

Here, `Args` is set as the name of the struct that binds to command line arguments. This will export a struct named `Args` in the global namespace, and its members will serve as parsers for the command line arguments, automatically parsing the command line arguments during initialization. All member variables in this struct must be one of the following two types:

- `Flag`: A parser for "flag-style" (`--var`) arguments. The constructor of `Flag` takes a `std::string` as the name of the command line argument (i.e., the `var` part in `--var`, excluding the preceding two dashes). When running this parser, it checks if `--var` exists in the command line arguments. If it does, it sets the member variable `value` to `true`; otherwise, it sets it to `false`.

- `Var<T>`: A parser for "variable-style" (`--var=<value>`) arguments, where `T` is the type of a variable template (which needs to be derived from the `cplib::var::Var`). The constructor of the `Var<T>` type takes an instance of type `T`, and the return value of its `name()` method serves as the name of the command line argument (i.e., the `var` part in `--var=<value>`, excluding the preceding two dashes). When running this parser, it calls the `read_from` function of type `T` to parse the `<value>` string, and stores the parsing result in the `value` member variable.

The `Args`, `Var<T>`, and `Flag` structures are all defined in the same hidden namespace, and only `Args` is exported to the global namespace, so there is no need to worry about global namespace pollution.

## Usage

The usage of the generator is similar to that of the checker. The only difference is that instead of passing file name arguments, you need to pass command-line arguments according to the definition of the `Args` structure.

## Suggestions

In summary, when writing more complex generators, we recommend the following suggestions:

- The generator needs to ensure that the generated result is only related to the command-line argument, so do not use functions like `std::time` or `std::clock` that may return different results each time they are called.
- Do not use `std::rand` or other custom generators. Instead, use `val.rnd`.
- Do not attempt to manually set the random number seed for `val.rnd`. Use the seed automatically generated in the `initializer` based on the command-line arguments.
- You can choose any way to output the data to standard output. However, to ensure the efficiency of `std::cout`, CPLib automatically disables the synchronization of C++ streams and stdio in generator mode, so do not mix C-style output (`std::printf`, etc.) and C++-style output (`std::cout`, etc.).
- If the data generation methods of multiple generator programs are roughly the same, you should merge them into one generator program and differentiate them using command-line arguments.
