# Initializer

<Callout type="info">
  The CPLib team maintains a set of initializers for mainstream platforms in the [cplib-initializers](https://github.com/rindag-devs/cplib-initializers) project. If your goal is solely to run your own programs on the target platform, you can visit the project repository to learn more about the details.
</Callout>

If you need to use CPLib on an evaluation platform that does not natively support it, the best way to use it is to implement a custom initializer. The following will use the example of writing a checker for the [CMS](https://cms-dev.github.io/) platform to demonstrate how to write a custom initializer.

The initializer needs to do three things:

1. Read and parse the command line arguments.
1. Set up the input/output streams and the Reader variable required by the program.
1. Set up the reporter.

According to the [CMS official documentation](https://github.com/cms-dev/cms/blob/v1.4/docs/Task%20types.rst#standard-manager-output), the execution details of the checker on this platform are as follows:

- The program is run using the command `./checker <inf> <ans> <ouf>`.
- When reporting, output a real number in the range $[0,1]$ to stdout as the score, and output a single string `translate:success`, `translate:wrong`, or `translate:partial` to stderr, representing the result AC, WA, or PC, respectively.
- If no internal errors occur, the checker's return value must be 0.

Here is a sample implementation:

```cpp
struct CmsReporter : cplib::checker::Reporter {
  [[noreturn]] auto report(const cplib::checker::Report &report)
      -> void override {
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(10) << report.score << '\n';

    switch (report.status) {
    case cplib::checker::Report::Status::INTERNAL_ERROR:
      std::clog << "FAIL " << report.status << '\n';
      std::exit(1);
    case cplib::checker::Report::Status::ACCEPTED:
      std::clog << "translate:success\n";
      break;
    case cplib::checker::Report::Status::WRONG_ANSWER:
      std::clog << "translate:wrong\n";
      break;
    case cplib::checker::Report::Status::PARTIALLY_CORRECT:
      std::clog << "translate:partial\n";
      break;
    default:
      std::clog << "FAIL invalid status\n";
      std::exit(1);
    }
    std::exit(0);
  }
};

struct CmsInitializer : cplib::checker::Initializer {
  auto init(std::string_view arg0, const std::vector<std::string> &args)
      -> void override {
    if (args.size() != 3) {
      std::cerr << "Usage: " << arg0 << " <inf> <ans> <ouf>\n";
      std::exit(1);
    }

    auto& state = this->state();

    state.reporter = std::make_unique<CmsReporter>();

    auto inf = args[0];
    auto ouf = args[2];
    auto ans = args[1];

    set_inf_path(inf, cplib::var::Reader::TraceLevel::NONE);
    set_ouf_path(ouf, cplib::var::Reader::TraceLevel::NONE);
    set_ans_path(ans, cplib::var::Reader::TraceLevel::NONE);
  }
};
```

The Reporter needs to inherit from `cplib::<work-mode>::Reporter` and implement the `[[noreturn]] auto report(const cplib::<work-mode>::Report &report) -> void` function.

The initializer needs to inherit from `cplib::<work-mode>Initializer` and implement the `auto init(std::string_view arg0, const std::vector<std::string> &args) -> void` function.

Let's focus on the implementation of `CmsInitializer`. It first implements the `init` function, where the parameter `arg0` represents the first item of the command line arguments (i.e., the path to the program being called), and `args` represents the subsequent arguments (`<inf> <ans> <ouf>`).

First, it calls `this->state()` to get the `cplib::checker::State` object that needs to be initialized. Then it extracts the paths of the input and output files from the `args` parameter. In this example, since the command line arguments are relatively simple, they can be processed directly. However, if the command line arguments are more complex, you can use `cplib::cmd_args::ParsedArgs` to process them.

<Callout type="info">
  For example, if a platform requires the command line arguments to be in the format `./chk <inf> <ouf> <ans> --full-score={int} [--report-as-json]`, you can process them as follows:

  ```cpp
  auto parsed_args = cplib::cmd_args::ParsedArgs(args);

  bool report_as_json = parsed_args.has_flag("report-as-json");
  int full_score = cplib::var::i32("full-score", 0, std::nullopt)
                       .parse(parsed_args.vars.at("full-score"));
  auto inf = parsed_args.ordered[0];
  auto ouf = parsed_args.ordered[1];
  auto ans = parsed_args.ordered[2];
  ```

  ParsedArgs will divide all command line arguments into three categories:

  - `var`: In the form of `--var=value` or `--var value`.
  - `flag`: In the form of `--flag`.
  - `ordered`: Elements that do not belong to the first two categories are stored in `ordered` in the order they appear.

Of note is the use of the `set_(inf|ouf|ans)_path` functions. To facilitate the initialization of input/output streams and the Reader, CPLib provides a series of functions in the form of `set_<name>_<source>` for objects that inherit from `cplib::checker::Initializer`, where `<name>` represents the name of the Reader or output stream, and `<source>` is either `fileno` or `path`, representing the use of the [fileno (file descriptor of stdio stream)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fileno.3.html) and local files as content, respectively.

For checkers, the available `<name>` values are as follows:

| Name |  Type  |       Description       |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| inf  | Reader | Input file              |
| ouf  | Reader | Participant output file |
| ans  | Reader | Answer file             |

For interactors, the available `<name>` values are as follows:

| Name     | Type    | Description    |
| --------- | ------- | -------------- |
| inf       | Reader  | Input file     |
| from_user | Reader  | User input     |
| to_user   | ostream | User output    |

For validators, the available `<name>` values are as follows:

| Name | Type   | Description    |
| ---- | ------ | -------------- |
| inf  | Reader | Input file     |

If the `<name>` type is Reader, an additional parameter representing the Reader's trace level needs to be passed, the meaning of which is explained in the [Trace](/user-guide/advanced/trace) chapter.

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not report errors by calling the `cplib::panic` function when implementing `Reporter::report`. This is because CPLib programs modify the panic implementation during initialization to call `Reporter::report` with `INTERNAL_ERROR` as the status, which will cause an infinite recursion.

  According to the LGPL license requirements, when you distribute software that uses CPLib, you need to indicate somewhere that the software uses CPLib, and that CPLib is licensed under the LGPL. Our recommended approach is to output relevant information when the command line argument contains `--help`. This tutorial has not been implemented to keep the code short. In actual projects, please be sure to strictly abide by the open source license.
