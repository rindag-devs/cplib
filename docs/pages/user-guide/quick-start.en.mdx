# Quick Start

## Get CPLib from Snapshot

CPLib is a library that consists only of header files. This means you don't have to worry about linking issues. The recommended way to use CPLib is to include the preprocessed single-header file. You can find the latest snapshot of the single-header file based on the main branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/rindag-devs/cplib/blob/single-header-snapshot/cplib.hpp).

Alternatively, you can download CPLib to a local folder using terminal commands.

<Tabs items={['UNIX-like', 'Windows']} storageKey="selected-os">
<Tab>
Open the terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
curl -o cplib.hpp -L https://github.com/rindag-devs/cplib/raw/single-header-snapshot/cplib.hpp
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
Launch PowerShell and enter the following command:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/rindag-devs/cplib/raw/single-header-snapshot/cplib.hpp" -OutFile "cplib.hpp"
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This will download the latest snapshot of the single-header file based on the main branch and save it as `cplib.hpp` in the current directory.

## Build from Source

In addition to using snapshots directly, building from source is another way to obtain a single file header.

<Steps>
### Clone Git Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rindag-devs/cplib.git --depth=1
cd cplib
```

### Install PNPM dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Build Single Header File

```bash
pnpm build-single-header
```

### Get Output File

The final code is stored in `out/single-header/cplib.hpp`.
</Steps>

## Start Learning

This document will explain how to use CPLib with examples. Additionally, whether you have prior experience using libraries like Testlib for development or not, it is recommended to start reading from the [Checker](/user-guide/basics/checker) chapter.
