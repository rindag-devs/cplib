CPLib is a library written in C++ for Competitive Programming. By using CPLib, you can write clear and efficient checkers, interactors, validators, and generators.

Compared to other popular libraries with similar functionalities, such as [Testlib](https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib), CPLib is more modern, extensible, and efficient.

One of the main purposes of CPLib is to replace Testlib and become the "universal tool" for problem setting.

This project is still in its early stages, so there may be many shortcomings in terms of functionality and stability. We appreciate your understanding.
